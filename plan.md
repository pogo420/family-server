# Plan in action:
## Software stack in mind
* Basic architecture 
```
--------      ----       ------       ---------------
| User | <-> | UI | <-> | APIs | <-> | H/W or DB etc |
--------      ----       ------       ---------------
```
* Accessible to only local network -> When hosted on phone.
   * Document all steps of deployment for fault recovery.
   * Limitation of hardware -> Manual deplyment.  


Future Plan or roadmap:
* Buy a dedicated system for home server deplyment.
